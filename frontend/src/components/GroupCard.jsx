/* 
Group card needs to:
    - import StudentRow
    - extract from its props the group data
    - loop through each student in the group  
    - for each student, a Student Row component needs to be instantiated 
    - the student's details (found from the group data) need to be passed into the StudentRow component via props
        - e.g. <Student firstName=_firstName email=_email classNum=_classNum wamAverage=_wamAverage enrolmentStatus=_enrolmentStatus discPersonality=_discPersonality >
